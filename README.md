# mysagecode

This folder contains drafts of Sage code for

1. computing products of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements in Hecke algebras;
2. computing products in Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebras;
3. computing the cacti group action on Coxeter groups.

The algorithm for 1 uses Sage's implementation of Fokko du Cloux's Coxeter3
package for fast computations of mu coefficients; we expect this makes the
product computation faster than the current algorithm in Sage.
